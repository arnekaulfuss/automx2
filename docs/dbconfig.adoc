=== Database configuration

automx2 uses the SQLAlchemy toolkit to access databases.
This allows a variety of databases, a.k.a. link:https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/dialects/[dialects], to be used, simply by defining the appropriate connection URL.

[NOTE]
.API based configuration
====
I consider adding an API for configuration changes in an upcoming version but have not decided when that might happen.
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in a <<Sponsorship,sponsorship>>.

==== Database support

While you probably already have SQLite support available on your local machine, you may need to install additional Python packages for PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
Detailed instructions to support a particular database dialect are out of scope for this document.
Please search the Internet for detailed instructions on supporting a particular dialect.
The SQLAlchemy documentation provides a useful starting point.

Instead of manually setting up tables, I recommend using the built-in method to create the necessary DB structure by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/initdb/` service endpoint.
This will also populate the database with some predefined example data.
Alternatively, you can send a POST request with custom JSON data to the same endpoint, as described below.

[IMPORTANT]
.Purging the database
====
Sending an HTTP DELETE request to `/initdb/` will purge all existing data.
Be sure to limit access to this service route accordingly!
====

If you upgrade from an early automx2 release and wish to migrate your existing database, you can use the built-in Alembic support.
However, this requires cloning the Git repository, modifying `alembic.ini` and invoking the migration from the command line.
It is usually easier to export your existing data, create a fresh DB and import the data.

==== SQLite

This section demonstrates what you need to do to in order to use SQLite version 3 or higher as a backend database for automx2.

Step 1: Set the database URI in your automx2 configuration.
Please note that specifying an absolute path for the database requires a total of four slashes after the schema identifier:

[source,ini]
----
[automx2]
db_uri = sqlite:////var/lib/automx2/db.sqlite
----

Step 2: Launch automx2 and access the DB initialisation URL.

[source,bash]
----
# Method 1: Populate DB with example data
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:4243/initdb/
# Method 2: Populate DB based on the content of a JSON file
curl -X POST --json @mydata.json http://127.0.0.1:4243/initdb/
----

Starting with automx2 version 2022.0, JSON data can be used to populate the database in a simplified manner, without the need to use SQL statements.
The required data format is as follows:

[source,json]
----
include::../contrib/seed-example.json[]
----

Sending JSON is the recommended method to populate the database. Some details like port numbers or socket types will be chosen for you, but you can later override them by modifying the DB directly.
Once you have populated the database automx2 is ready to run.

==== MySQL

Step 1: Create a database.

[source,mysql]
----
CREATE DATABASE `automx2` COLLATE 'utf8mb4_general_ci';
----

Step 2: Set the database URI in your automx2 configuration.
The following example uses _pymysql_ as a DB driver, which is not included in the automx2 distribution.

[source,ini]
----
[automx2]
db_uri = mysql+pymysql://user:pass@dbhost/automx2?charset=utf8mb4
----

Step 3: Launch automx2 and access the DB initialisation URL:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:4243/initdb/
----

==== PostgreSQL

Step 1: Create a database.

[source,postgresql]
----
CREATE DATABASE automx2 LOCALE 'en_US.utf8';
----

Step 2: Set the database URI in your automx2 configuration.
The following example uses _psycopg2_ as a DB driver, which is not included in the automx2 distribution.

[source,ini]
----
[automx2]
db_uri = postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@dbhost/automx2
----

Step 3: Launch automx2 and access the DB initialisation URL:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://127.0.0.1:4243/initdb/
----
